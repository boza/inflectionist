Inflectionist
=============

The old school ActiveSupport's inflections allowed you to pluralize, singularize , humanize etc. And when you wanted little more complex linguistic processing , you found nothing. Here comes Inflectionist for your rescue. It is an extension to ActiveSupport inflections available in form of a rails plugin. For now, this will allow you to find simple past tense of any given word.     



Example
=======

 "create".past_tensed  => "created"
 "buy".past_tensed => "baught"
 "fight".past_tensed => "faught"
 "market".past_tensed => "marketed"
 "animate".past_tensed => "animated"
 "fluctuate".past_tensed => "fluctuated"
 "tag".past_tensed => "tagged"
 "feel".past_tensed => "felt"
